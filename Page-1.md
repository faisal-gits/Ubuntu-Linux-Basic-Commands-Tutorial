## Page 1: Introduction to Essential Linux Commands

In this tutorial, we will explore essential Ubuntu Linux commands that every user should know. These commands are the building blocks for navigating and managing your Linux system efficiently.

### 1. `ls` - List Directory Contents

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. By default, it displays the files and directories in the current directory.

Example:
```
ls
```

### 2. `pwd` - Print Working Directory

`pwd` stands for "Print Working Directory." It shows the full path of the current working directory, helping you understand where you are in the file system.

Example:
```
pwd
```

### 3. `cd` - Change Directory

The `cd` command is used to change the current working directory. You can navigate to different directories by specifying the directory's path.

Example:
```
cd /path/to/directory
```

### 4. `mkdir` - Make Directory

Use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory (folder) in the current working directory.

Example:
```
mkdir new_folder
```

### 5. `rmdir` - Remove Directory

`rmdir` is used to remove an empty directory. Be cautious, as it won't work if the directory contains files.

Example:
```
rmdir empty_directory
```

### 6. `rm` - Remove File

The `rm` command deletes files. To remove a file, provide its name as an argument.

Example:
```
rm file.txt
```

### 7. `cp` - Copy Files and Directories

With `cp`, you can copy files and directories from one location to another. Include the source and destination paths.

Example:
```
cp source.txt destination/
```

### 8. `mv` - Move or Rename Files and Directories

The `mv` command moves files and directories to a different location or renames them.

Example:
```
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

### 9. `touch` - Create Empty File

Use `touch` to create a new empty file with the specified name.

Example:
```
touch newfile.txt
```

### 10. `file` - Check File Type

`file` allows you to determine a file's type (e.g., text, binary, or compressed).

Example:
```
file document.pdf
```
